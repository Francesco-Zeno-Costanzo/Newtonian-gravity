Brief explanation of the codes:

proiettile muro simulates the motion of a projectile that crosses a wall of a certain material with a certain viscosity.

Gravitazione2d(2corpi) solves the problem of 2 bodies in 2 dimensions, simulating a star-planet system.

Gravitazione2d(3corpi) solves the problem of 3 bodies in 2 dimensions, simulating a star-planet-satellite system.

Gravitazione3d(2corpi) solves the problem of 2 bodies in 3 dimensions, simulating a star-planet system.

Gravitazione3d(3corpi) solves the problem of 3 bodies in 3 dimensions, simulating a star-planet-planet system.


(the following codes use the classes, as they simplify the writing of the code and the management of the N bodies)
bin_sist    solves the problem of 3 bodies in 2 dimensions, simulating a star-star-planet system.

N_corpi(2d) solves the problem of N bodies in 2 dimensions.

N_corpi(3d) solves the problem of N bodies in 3 dimensions.
